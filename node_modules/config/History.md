1.12.0 / 2015-02-19
===================

  * Better date merging @axelhzf

1.11.0 / 2015-01-14
===================

===================

  * Another year - changed copyright messages for 2015
  * Updated contributors list
  * New Strict Mode added in 1.9.0 is now documented. (@markstos)
  * has() now returns false when given an undefined or null key to look up. Previously it threw an exception. (@markstos)
  * When get() is given an undefined or null key to look up, it now throws a more helpful diagnostic (@robludwig, @markstos)

1.9.0 / 2014-12-08
==================

  * New strictness checks have been added to ensure the expected configuration has been loaded. Warnings are now thrown in these cases. If NODE_CONFIG_STRICT_MODE is set, exceptions are thrown instead. (@markstos)
    * There must be an explicit config file matching `NODE_ENV` if `NODE_ENV` is set.
    * There must be an explicit config file matching `NODE_APP_INSTANCE` if `NODE_APP_INSTANCE` is set
    * `NODE_ENV` must not match 'default' or 'local' to avoid ambiguity.

  * Added .iced extension support (@arthanzel)

  * Highlight `config.has()` in the README. Use it to check to if a value exists, since `config.get()`
    throws exceptions on undefined values. (@markstos)

  * API Change: getConfigSources() now starts to return data on config files that are valid-but-empty. (@markstos)

1.8.1 / 2014-11-14
